# TODO

## Current

- Add the time-lapse/time-machine utility. It's important to do this early, so that it is useful for the entire project history. Alternatively, add it as its own (subrepo'd) tool, with an installer that places the executable outside of the workspace. Yeah, that.

## Backlog

- [README](../README.md): Add usage instructions `ws-changes`:
  - Updating CHANGELOG.md for each "change".
  - Including commit message summary in front matter `head`.
- [CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md): Given the `ws-changes` approach, it would be nice to have a sort of merge of the Changelog protocol with [recommended](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) [patterns](https://joshuatauberer.medium.com/write-joyous-git-commit-messages-2f98891114c4) for good git commit messages.
