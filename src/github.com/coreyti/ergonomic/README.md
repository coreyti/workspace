# Ergonomic

## Overview

This "workspace" provides an approach to helping teams and individuals do "work" on related projects and products. While the design of the workspace is intended to improve efficiency and efficacy when working with the projects, a central concern is that its usage be entirely optional, and using it should not result in challenges created for non-users.

## Guiding Principles

- As noted above and most importantly, usage of this workspace must be optional. Colleagues should always be able to work on projects should be independently of the workspace without challenges introduced by the existence or intention of the workspace; consumers should be able to choose from using the workspace or any sub-project.
